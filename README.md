## TLDR;

This repository was created as part of the second stage recruitment process for the Frontend Developer (Next.js & React.js - Tailwind) position at [dokan.sa](https://dokan.sa). The UI design was referenced from the Figma link provided [here](https://www.figma.com/design/mJo8N3vdOh3gjVmIKy4mCb/Dokan-Front-End-Test?node-id=0-1&t=G68qBmFCjF0qkyH1-1).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Available Pages
